  support certain optional features. These libraries bear their own<BR>
  copyrights and licenses, which may be more or less restrictive than the<BR>
  GraphicsMagick license. For convenience, when GraphicsMagick is<BR>
  bundled with (or compiled with) &quot;delegate&quot; libraries, a copy of the<BR>
  licenses for these libraries is provided in a &quot;licenses&quot; directory.<BR>
