<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
Returns true on success and false on failure.<BR>
<BR>
This function has 4 behaviors depending on the parameters:<BR>
<BR>
1. If mask is nil and no ForeColour and MaskColour values are passed, the pixels a copied to the destination picture.<BR>
<BR>
2. But if there is a mask, the pixels are copied with applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
3. If the mask color is not defined, the the pixels are filled with the fore color applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
4. As the last variation the pixels are copied and the forecolor, the mask color or black is used with the image as the mask. If UseColours parameter is false black is used for this.<BR>
<BR>
Parameters:<BR>
Image: the source picture, must not be nil.<BR>
PreMultipliedSource: Optional parameter. If true the image must be premultiplied. Default is false.<BR>
Mask: the mask picture, can be nil.<BR>
DestX: destination position<BR>
DestY: destination position<BR>
SourceX: source position<BR>
SourceY: source position<BR>
Width: width of the area to copy<BR>
Height: height of the area to copy<BR>
UseColours: whether to use the mask colour.<BR>
ForeColour: the fore colour, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
MaskColour: the mask color, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
<BR>
This function is 5 times in the plugin defined to implement having the last two parameters optional and either integer or color. You can pass a negative number for MaskColour or ForeColour to disable this parameter.<BR>
<BR>
The images you use can be Gray, RGB with or without alpha channels. But most variants here ignore alpha channels. To make sure the alpha channel is not touched, use the <A href="class-picturembs.html">PictureMBS</A>.RGBChannels function and pass that new <A href="class-picturembs.html">PictureMBS</A>.<BR>

<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
Returns true on success and false on failure.<BR>
<BR>
This function has 4 behaviors depending on the parameters:<BR>
<BR>
1. If mask is nil and no ForeColour and MaskColour values are passed, the pixels a copied to the destination picture.<BR>
<BR>
2. But if there is a mask, the pixels are copied with applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
3. If the mask color is not defined, the the pixels are filled with the fore color applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
4. As the last variation the pixels are copied and the forecolor, the mask color or black is used with the image as the mask. If UseColours parameter is false black is used for this.<BR>
<BR>
Parameters:<BR>
Image: the source picture, must not be nil.<BR>
PreMultipliedSource: Optional parameter. If true the image must be premultiplied. Default is false.<BR>
Mask: the mask picture, can be nil.<BR>
DestX: destination position<BR>
DestY: destination position<BR>
SourceX: source position<BR>
SourceY: source position<BR>
Width: width of the area to copy<BR>
Height: height of the area to copy<BR>
UseColours: whether to use the mask colour.<BR>
ForeColour: the fore colour, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
MaskColour: the mask color, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
<BR>
This function is 5 times in the plugin defined to implement having the last two parameters optional and either integer or color. You can pass a negative number for MaskColour or ForeColour to disable this parameter.<BR>
<BR>
The images you use can be Gray, RGB with or without alpha channels. But most variants here ignore alpha channels. To make sure the alpha channel is not touched, use the <A href="class-picturembs.html">PictureMBS</A>.RGBChannels function and pass that new <A href="class-picturembs.html">PictureMBS</A>.<BR>

<B>Function:</B> 
Copies pixels from one picture into another picture with some options.<BR>
<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
Returns true on success and false on failure.<BR>
<BR>
This function has 4 behaviors depending on the parameters:<BR>
<BR>
1. If mask is nil and no ForeColour and MaskColour values are passed, the pixels a copied to the destination picture.<BR>
<BR>
2. But if there is a mask, the pixels are copied with applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
3. If the mask color is not defined, the the pixels are filled with the fore color applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
4. As the last variation the pixels are copied and the forecolor, the mask color or black is used with the image as the mask. If UseColours parameter is false black is used for this.<BR>
<BR>
Parameters:<BR>
Image: the source picture, must not be nil.<BR>
PreMultipliedSource: Optional parameter. If true the image must be premultiplied. Default is false.<BR>
Mask: the mask picture, can be nil.<BR>
DestX: destination position<BR>
DestY: destination position<BR>
SourceX: source position<BR>
SourceY: source position<BR>
Width: width of the area to copy<BR>
Height: height of the area to copy<BR>
UseColours: whether to use the mask colour.<BR>
ForeColour: the fore colour, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
MaskColour: the mask color, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
<BR>
This function is 5 times in the plugin defined to implement having the last two parameters optional and either integer or color. You can pass a negative number for MaskColour or ForeColour to disable this parameter.<BR>
<BR>
The images you use can be Gray, RGB with or without alpha channels. But most variants here ignore alpha channels. To make sure the alpha channel is not touched, use the <A href="class-picturembs.html">PictureMBS</A>.RGBChannels function and pass that new <A href="class-picturembs.html">PictureMBS</A>.<BR>

<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
All drawings in the Picture and in the <A href="class-picturembs.html">PictureMBS</A> object will be visible in both objects.<BR>
This function works on Mac OS and Windows with both 24 bit and 32 bit pictures.<BR>
On Mac this function can fail if the picture is not a GWorld (Bitmap) picture. <BR>
<BR>
The Valid property is set to true on success.<BR>
<BR>
If you set UseAlpha=True, the 4th channel in a 32 bit picture is available for you as an alpha channel. Xojo does not use the 4th channel in the picture data and 24 bit pictures do not have one. So you can use 32 bit pictures, copy the pictures mask in the alpha channel (using <A href="class-picturembs.html">PictureMBS</A>.AlphaChannel. inverting may be needed), perform some operations and later make a copy of the of the image to a picture and extract the alpha channel back into the pictue&#39;s mask.<BR>
<BR>
Added support for Console/Web targets in 12.2 plugins. Please be aware that alpha channel of pictures with alpha channel has only a range from 0 to 127 for the values.<BR>

<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
The size of this image is limited to available hard disc space.<BR>
The system will cache this data in memory to avoid writing it to disc. Using picture sizes bigger than physical memory can result into slow processing.<BR>
<BR>
FilePath points to the location where the file is created.<BR>
On Windows the FilePath can be nil in which space in the system swapfile is used.<BR>
On Mac/Linux with nil FilePath, we use automatically a temp file path.<BR>
<BR>
BlockSize specifies how many bytes of memory should be used in application memory space. A typical value may be 100 mega bytes.<BR>
<BR>
The Valid property is set to true on success.<BR>
File is deleted in destructor and folderitem is than invalid.<BR>

Copies the alpha channel into a mask picture.<BR>
<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
Be aware that <A href="class-picturembs.html">PictureMBS</A> objects can have more pixels than picture objects can store, so this will not always work.<BR>
Returns nil on any error (e.g. out of memory).<BR>
Works for all pictures with alpha channel.<BR>
