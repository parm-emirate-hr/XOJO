INTRODUCTION<BR>
<BR>
CUPS(tm) is provided under the GNU General Public License (&quot;GPL&quot;)<BR>
and GNU Library General Public License (&quot;LGPL&quot;), Version 2, with<BR>
exceptions for Apple operating systems and the OpenSSL toolkit. A<BR>
copy of the exceptions and licenses follow this introduction.<BR>
<BR>
The GNU LGPL applies to the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries<BR>
located in the &quot;cups&quot; and &quot;filter&quot; subdirectories of the CUPS<BR>
source distribution and in the &quot;cups&quot; include directory and<BR>
library files in the binary distributions. The GNU GPL applies to<BR>
the remainder of the CUPS distribution, including the &quot;pdftops&quot;<BR>
filter which is based upon Xpdf.<BR>
<BR>
For those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically<BR>
allows you to:<BR>
<BR>
   - Use the CUPS software at no charge.<BR>
   - Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source or<BR>
     binary form.<BR>
   - Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media fee, or<BR>
     sell support for the software.<BR>
<BR>
What this license *does not* allow you to do is make changes or<BR>
add features to CUPS and then sell a binary distribution without<BR>
source code. You must provide source for any changes or additions<BR>
to the software, and all code must be provided under the GPL or<BR>
LGPL as appropriate. The only exceptions to this are the portions<BR>
of the CUPS software covered by the Apple operating system<BR>
license exceptions outlined later in this license agreement.<BR>
<BR>
The GNU LGPL relaxes the &quot;link-to&quot; restriction, allowing you to<BR>
develop applications that use the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries<BR>
under other licenses and/or conditions as appropriate for your<BR>
application, driver, or filter.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
LICENSE EXCEPTIONS<BR>
<BR>
In addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Apple Inc. grants<BR>
the following special exceptions:<BR>
<BR>
     1. Apple Operating System Development License Exception;<BR>
<BR>
a. Software that is developed by any person or entity<BR>
   for an Apple Operating System (&quot;Apple OS-Developed<BR>
   Software&quot;), including but not limited to Apple and<BR>
   third party printer drivers, filters, and backends<BR>
   for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the<BR>
   CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters<BR>
   or backends provided with CUPS shall not be<BR>
   considered to be a derivative work or collective work<BR>
   based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the<BR>
   mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL.<BR>
   You may therefore distribute linked combinations of<BR>
   the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed<BR>
   Software without releasing the source code of the<BR>
   Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample<BR>
   filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop<BR>
   Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the<BR>
   source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software.<BR>
<BR>
b. An Apple Operating System means any operating system<BR>
   software developed and/or marketed by Apple Computer,<BR>
   Inc., including but not limited to all existing<BR>
   releases and versions of Apple&#39;s Darwin, Mac OS X,<BR>
   and Mac OS X Server products and all follow-on<BR>
   releases and future versions thereof.<BR>
<BR>
c. This exception is only available for Apple<BR>
   OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software<BR>
   that is distributed for use on other operating<BR>
   systems.<BR>
<BR>
d. All CUPS software that falls under this license<BR>
   exception have the following text at the top of each<BR>
   source file:<BR>
<BR>
     This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed<BR>
     Software exception.<BR>
<BR>
     2. OpenSSL Toolkit License Exception;<BR>
<BR>
a. Apple Inc. explicitly allows the compilation and<BR>
   distribution of the CUPS software with the OpenSSL<BR>
   Toolkit.<BR>
<BR>
No developer is required to provide these exceptions in a<BR>
derived work.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
KERBEROS SUPPORT CODE<BR>
<BR>
The Kerberos support code (&quot;KSC&quot;) is copyright 2006 by Jelmer<BR>
Vernooij and is provided &#39;as-is&#39;, without any express or implied<BR>
warranty.  In no event will the author or Apple Inc. be held<BR>
liable for any damages arising from the use of the KSC.<BR>
<BR>
Sources files containing KSC have the following text at the top<BR>
of each source file:<BR>
<BR>
     This file contains Kerberos support code, copyright 2006 by<BR>
     Jelmer Vernooij.<BR>
<BR>
The KSC copyright and license apply only to Kerberos-related<BR>
feature code in CUPS.  Such code is typically conditionally<BR>
compiled based on the present of the HAVE_GSSAPI preprocessor<BR>
definition.<BR>
<BR>
Permission is granted to anyone to use the KSC for any purpose,<BR>
including commercial applications, and to alter it and<BR>
redistribute it freely, subject to the following restrictions:<BR>
<BR>
     1. The origin of the KSC must not be misrepresented; you<BR>
must not claim that you wrote the original software. If<BR>
you use the KSC in a product, an acknowledgment in the<BR>
product documentation would be appreciated but is not<BR>
required.<BR>
<BR>
     2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such,<BR>
and must not be misrepresented as being the original<BR>
software.<BR>
<BR>
     3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source<BR>
distribution. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
TRADEMARKS<BR>
<BR>
CUPS and the CUPS logo (the &quot;CUPS Marks&quot;) are trademarks of Apple<BR>
Inc. Apple grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable right<BR>
to use the CUPS Marks in any direct port or binary distribution<BR>
incorporating CUPS software and in any promotional material<BR>
therefor.  You agree that your products will meet the highest<BR>
levels of quality and integrity for similar goods, not be unlawful,<BR>
and be developed, manufactured, and distributed in compliance with<BR>
this license.  You will not interfere with Apple&#39;s rights in the<BR>
CUPS Marks, and all use of the CUPS Marks shall inure to the<BR>
benefit of Apple.  This license does not apply to use of the CUPS<BR>
Marks in a derivative products, which requires prior written<BR>
permission from Apple Inc.<BR>
<BR>
    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>
       Version 2, June 1991<BR>
<BR>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR>
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<BR>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR>
<BR>
    Preamble<BR>
<BR>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<BR>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<BR>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<BR>
Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to<BR>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<BR>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<BR>
your programs, too.<BR>
<BR>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<BR>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<BR>
<BR>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<BR>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<BR>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<BR>
<BR>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<BR>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<BR>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<BR>
rights.<BR>
<BR>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<BR>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<BR>
distribute and/or modify the software.<BR>
<BR>
  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain<BR>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<BR>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<BR>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<BR>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<BR>
authors&#39; reputations.<BR>
<BR>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<BR>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<BR>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<BR>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<BR>
patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.<BR>
<BR>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>
modification follow.<BR>
<BR>
    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR>
<BR>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<BR>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<BR>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<BR>
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<BR>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<BR>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<BR>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<BR>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<BR>
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<BR>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<BR>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<BR>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<BR>
<BR>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s<BR>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<BR>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<BR>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<BR>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<BR>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<BR>
along with the Program.<BR>
<BR>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<BR>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<BR>
<BR>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<BR>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<BR>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR>
<BR>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<BR>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR>
<BR>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<BR>
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<BR>
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<BR>
    parties under the terms of this License.<BR>
<BR>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<BR>
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<BR>
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<BR>
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<BR>
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<BR>
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<BR>
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<BR>
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<BR>
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<BR>
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<BR>
<BR>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<BR>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>
collective works based on the Program.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<BR>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<BR>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>
the scope of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<BR>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<BR>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<BR>
<BR>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<BR>
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<BR>
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR>
<BR>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<BR>
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<BR>
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<BR>
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<BR>
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<BR>
    customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR>
<BR>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<BR>
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<BR>
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<BR>
    received the program in object code or executable form with such<BR>
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<BR>
<BR>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<BR>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<BR>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<BR>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<BR>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<BR>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<BR>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<BR>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<BR>
itself accompanies the executable.<BR>
<BR>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<BR>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<BR>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<BR>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR>
<BR>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<BR>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<BR>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<BR>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<BR>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<BR>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<BR>
parties remain in full compliance.<BR>
<BR>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<BR>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>
the Program or works based on it.<BR>
<BR>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<BR>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<BR>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>
restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>
this License.<BR>
<BR>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<BR>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<BR>
<BR>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<BR>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<BR>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<BR>
circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<BR>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>
impose that choice.<BR>
<BR>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<BR>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<BR>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<BR>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<BR>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<BR>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>
address new problems or concerns.<BR>
<BR>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<BR>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<BR>
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<BR>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<BR>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<BR>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<BR>
Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<BR>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<BR>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<BR>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<BR>
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<BR>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<BR>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<BR>
<BR>
    false WARRANTY<BR>
<BR>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS false WARRANTY<BR>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<BR>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<BR>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<BR>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<BR>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<BR>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<BR>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<BR>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR>
<BR>
  12. IN false EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<BR>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<BR>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<BR>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<BR>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<BR>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<BR>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<BR>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<BR>
<BR>
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR>
<BR>
Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR>
<BR>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR>
<BR>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR>
<BR>
    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<BR>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;<BR>
<BR>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<BR>
    (at your option) any later version.<BR>
<BR>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<BR>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<BR>
<BR>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<BR>
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<BR>
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.<BR>
<BR>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR>
<BR>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<BR>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<BR>

The hypothetical commands &#39;show w&#39; and &#39;show c&#39; should show the appropriate<BR>

be called something other than &#39;show w&#39; and &#39;show c&#39;; they could even be<BR>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<BR>
<BR>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<BR>
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if<BR>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<BR>

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<BR>
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<BR>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<BR>
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<BR>
Public License instead of this License.<BR>

  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>
 Version 2, June 1991<BR>
<BR>
  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR>
       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<BR>
<BR>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR>
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR>
<BR>
    [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is<BR>
   numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<BR>
<BR>
       Preamble<BR>
<BR>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<BR>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<BR>
<BR>
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<BR>
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<BR>
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for<BR>
your libraries, too.<BR>
<BR>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<BR>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<BR>
<BR>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<BR>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<BR>
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<BR>
<BR>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<BR>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<BR>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<BR>
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide<BR>
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<BR>
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<BR>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<BR>
<BR>
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<BR>
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<BR>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<BR>
<BR>
  Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain<BR>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<BR>
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<BR>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<BR>
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<BR>
the original authors&#39; reputations.<BR>
<BR>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<BR>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<BR>
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<BR>
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,<BR>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s<BR>
free use or not licensed at all.<BR>
<BR>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<BR>
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This<BR>
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<BR>
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary<BR>
one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is<BR>
the same as in the ordinary license.<BR>
<BR>
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<BR>
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<BR>
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without<BR>
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<BR>
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in<BR>
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<BR>
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<BR>
treats it as such.<BR>
<BR>
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<BR>
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<BR>
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We<BR>
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<BR>
<BR>
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<BR>
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<BR>
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to<BR>
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<BR>
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<BR>
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve<BR>
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<BR>
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this<BR>
will lead to faster development of free libraries.<BR>
<BR>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<BR>
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The<BR>
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<BR>
works together with the library.<BR>
<BR>
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<BR>
General Public License rather than by this special one.<BR>
<BR>
  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR>
<BR>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<BR>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<BR>
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<BR>
General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is<BR>
addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<BR>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<BR>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<BR>
<BR>
  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<BR>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the<BR>
Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<BR>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<BR>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<BR>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<BR>
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<BR>
<BR>
  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<BR>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<BR>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<BR>
and installation of the library.<BR>
<BR>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<BR>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<BR>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<BR>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<BR>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<BR>
<BR>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s<BR>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<BR>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<BR>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<BR>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<BR>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<BR>
Library.<BR>
<BR>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<BR>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<BR>
fee.<BR>
<BR>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<BR>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<BR>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR>
<BR>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<BR>
<BR>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<BR>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR>
<BR>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<BR>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<BR>
<BR>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<BR>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<BR>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<BR>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<BR>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<BR>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<BR>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<BR>
<BR>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<BR>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<BR>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<BR>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<BR>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<BR>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<BR>
<BR>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<BR>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<BR>
it.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>
collective works based on the Library.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<BR>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<BR>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>
the scope of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<BR>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<BR>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<BR>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<BR>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<BR>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<BR>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<BR>
these notices.<BR>
<BR>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<BR>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<BR>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<BR>
<BR>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<BR>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<BR>
<BR>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<BR>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<BR>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<BR>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<BR>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<BR>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<BR>
<BR>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<BR>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<BR>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<BR>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR>
<BR>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<BR>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<BR>
linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a<BR>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<BR>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<BR>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<BR>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<BR>
library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<BR>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<BR>
<BR>
  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<BR>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<BR>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<BR>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<BR>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<BR>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<BR>
<BR>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<BR>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<BR>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<BR>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<BR>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<BR>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<BR>
<BR>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<BR>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<BR>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<BR>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<BR>
<BR>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<BR>
link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<BR>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<BR>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<BR>
modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse<BR>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<BR>
<BR>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<BR>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<BR>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<BR>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<BR>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<BR>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<BR>
of these things:<BR>
<BR>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<BR>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<BR>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<BR>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<BR>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<BR>
    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<BR>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<BR>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<BR>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<BR>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<BR>
    to use the modified definitions.)<BR>
<BR>
    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<BR>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<BR>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<BR>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<BR>
<BR>
    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<BR>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<BR>
    specified materials from the same place.<BR>
<BR>
    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<BR>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<BR>
<BR>
  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<BR>
Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<BR>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<BR>
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<BR>
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<BR>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<BR>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<BR>
the executable.<BR>
<BR>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<BR>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<BR>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<BR>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<BR>
distribute.<BR>
<BR>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<BR>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<BR>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<BR>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<BR>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<BR>
<BR>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<BR>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<BR>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<BR>
    Sections above.<BR>
<BR>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<BR>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<BR>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR>
<BR>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<BR>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<BR>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<BR>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<BR>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<BR>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<BR>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<BR>
<BR>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<BR>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>
the Library or works based on it.<BR>
<BR>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<BR>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<BR>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>
restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>
this License.<BR>
<BR>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<BR>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<BR>
<BR>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<BR>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<BR>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<BR>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>
impose that choice.<BR>
<BR>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<BR>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<BR>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<BR>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<BR>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<BR>
written in the body of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<BR>
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<BR>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<BR>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR>
<BR>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<BR>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<BR>
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<BR>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<BR>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<BR>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<BR>
the Free Software Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<BR>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<BR>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<BR>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<BR>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<BR>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<BR>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<BR>
and reuse of software generally.<BR>
<BR>
    false WARRANTY<BR>
<BR>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS false<BR>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<BR>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<BR>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<BR>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<BR>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<BR>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<BR>
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<BR>
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR>
<BR>
  16. IN false EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<BR>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<BR>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<BR>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<BR>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<BR>
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<BR>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<BR>
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<BR>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<BR>
DAMAGES.<BR>
<BR>
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR>
<BR>
     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<BR>
<BR>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<BR>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<BR>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<BR>
ordinary General Public License).<BR>
<BR>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<BR>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<BR>
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR>
<BR>
    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<BR>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<BR>
<BR>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<BR>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<BR>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<BR>
    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<BR>
<BR>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<BR>
    Library General Public License for more details.<BR>
<BR>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public<BR>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free<BR>
    Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.<BR>
<BR>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR>
<BR>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<BR>
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if<BR>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<BR>
<BR>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<BR>
