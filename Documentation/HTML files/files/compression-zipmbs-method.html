Level: contain the level of compression (a value from -1 to 9. see Compression* constants)<BR>
Zip64: If you want to have the zip file support more than 2 GB of data, set this to true to create a 64 bit file.<BR>
Raw: If true you read the file raw (the data will not be compressed).<BR>
windowBits: Parameters for zlib compression. (for example -15)<BR>
memLevel: Parameters for zlib compression. (for example 8 or 9)<BR>
Strategy: Parameters for zlib compression. (See Strategy* constants)<BR>
Password: The password to use.<BR>
crcForCtypting: the CRC value of the input file.<BR>
<BR>
The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size (the size of the history buffer). It should be in the range 8..15 for this version of the library. Larger values of this parameter result in better compression at the expense of memory usage. The default value is 15.<BR>
<BR>
windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw deflate. In this case, -windowBits determines the window size. <BR>
<BR>
The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated for the internal compression state. memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but is slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory for optimal speed. The default value is 8. See zconf.h for total memory usage as a function of windowBits and memLevel.<BR>
<BR>
The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the value StrategyDefault for normal data, StrategyFiltered for data produced by a filter (or predictor), StrategyHuffmanOnly to force Huffman encoding only (no string match), or StrategyRLE to limit match distances to one (run-length encoding). Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to compress them better. The effect of StrategyFiltered is to force more Huffman coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between StrategyDefault and StrategyHuffmanOnly. StrategyRLE is designed to be almost as fast as StrategyHuffmanOnly, but give better compression for PNG image data. The strategy parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the correctness of the compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.  StrategyFixed prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler decoder for special applications.<BR>
