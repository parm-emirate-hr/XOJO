<B>Function:</B> 
Copies pixels from one picture into another picture with some options.<BR>
<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
Returns true on success and false on failure.<BR>
<BR>
This function has 4 behaviors depending on the parameters:<BR>
<BR>
1. If mask is nil and no ForeColour and MaskColour values are passed, the pixels a copied to the destination picture.<BR>
<BR>
2. But if there is a mask, the pixels are copied with applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
3. If the mask color is not defined, the the pixels are filled with the fore color applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
4. As the last variation the pixels are copied and the forecolor, the mask color or black is used with the image as the mask. If UseColours parameter is false black is used for this.<BR>
<BR>
Parameters:<BR>
Image: the source picture, must not be nil.<BR>
Mask: the mask picture, can be nil.<BR>
DestX: destination position<BR>
DestY: destination position<BR>
SourceX: source position<BR>
SourceY: source position<BR>
Width: width of the area to copy<BR>
Height: height of the area to copy<BR>
UseColours: whether to use the mask colour.<BR>
ForeColour: the fore colour, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
MaskColour: the mask color, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
<BR>
This function is 5 times in the plugin defined to implement having the last two parameters optional and either integer or color. You can pass a negative number for MaskColour or ForeColour to disable this parameter.<BR>
<BR>
The destination image (self) can be either 24 bit or 32 bit.<BR>

<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
Returns true on success and false on failure.<BR>
<BR>
This function has 4 behaviors depending on the parameters:<BR>
<BR>
1. If mask is nil and no ForeColour and MaskColour values are passed, the pixels a copied to the destination picture.<BR>
<BR>
2. But if there is a mask, the pixels are copied with applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
3. If the mask color is not defined, the the pixels are filled with the fore color applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
4. As the last variation the pixels are copied and the forecolor, the mask color or black is used with the image as the mask. If UseColours parameter is false black is used for this.<BR>
<BR>
Parameters:<BR>
Image: the source picture, must not be nil.<BR>
Mask: the mask picture, can be nil.<BR>
DestX: destination position<BR>
DestY: destination position<BR>
SourceX: source position<BR>
SourceY: source position<BR>
Width: width of the area to copy<BR>
Height: height of the area to copy<BR>
UseColours: whether to use the mask colour.<BR>
ForeColour: the fore colour, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
MaskColour: the mask color, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
<BR>
This function is 5 times in the plugin defined to implement having the last two parameters optional and either integer or color. You can pass a negative number for MaskColour or ForeColour to disable this parameter.<BR>
<BR>
The destination image (self) can be either 24 bit or 32 bit.<BR>

<B>Function:</B> 
Copies pixels from one picture into another picture with some options.<BR>
<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
Returns true on success and false on failure.<BR>
<BR>
This function has 4 behaviors depending on the parameters:<BR>
<BR>
1. If mask is nil and no ForeColour and MaskColour values are passed, the pixels a copied to the destination picture.<BR>
<BR>
2. But if there is a mask, the pixels are copied with applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
3. If the mask color is not defined, the the pixels are filled with the fore color applying the mask.<BR>
<BR>
4. As the last variation the pixels are copied and the forecolor, the mask color or black is used with the image as the mask. If UseColours parameter is false black is used for this.<BR>
<BR>
Parameters:<BR>
Image: the source picture, must not be nil.<BR>
PreMultipliedSource: Optional parameter. If true the image must be premultiplied. Default is false.<BR>
Mask: the mask picture, can be nil.<BR>
DestX: destination position<BR>
DestY: destination position<BR>
SourceX: source position<BR>
SourceY: source position<BR>
Width: width of the area to copy<BR>
Height: height of the area to copy<BR>
UseColours: whether to use the mask colour.<BR>
ForeColour: the fore colour, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
MaskColour: the mask color, optional, can be integer or color<BR>
<BR>
This function is 5 times in the plugin defined to implement having the last two parameters optional and either integer or color. You can pass a negative number for MaskColour or ForeColour to disable this parameter.<BR>
<BR>
The destination image (self) can be either 24 bit or 32 bit.<BR>
