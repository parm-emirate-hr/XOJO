  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>
       Version 2.1, February 1999<BR>
<BR>
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR>
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<BR>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR>
<BR>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<BR>
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<BR>
 the version number 2.1.]<BR>
<BR>
    Preamble<BR>
<BR>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<BR>
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<BR>
<BR>
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<BR>
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<BR>
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<BR>
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<BR>
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<BR>
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<BR>
<BR>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<BR>
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<BR>
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<BR>
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<BR>
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<BR>
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<BR>
these things.<BR>
<BR>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<BR>
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<BR>
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<BR>
<BR>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<BR>
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<BR>
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<BR>
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<BR>
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<BR>
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<BR>
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<BR>
<BR>
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<BR>
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<BR>
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<BR>
<BR>
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<BR>
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<BR>
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<BR>
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<BR>
author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<BR>
introduced by others.<BR>
<BR>
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<BR>
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<BR>
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<BR>
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<BR>
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<BR>
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<BR>
<BR>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<BR>
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<BR>
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<BR>
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<BR>
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<BR>
libraries into non-free programs.<BR>
<BR>
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<BR>
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<BR>
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<BR>
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<BR>
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<BR>
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<BR>
the library.<BR>
<BR>
  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it<BR>
does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General<BR>
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<BR>
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<BR>
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<BR>
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<BR>
special circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<BR>
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<BR>
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<BR>
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<BR>
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<BR>
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<BR>
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<BR>
<BR>
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<BR>
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<BR>
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<BR>
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<BR>
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<BR>
system.<BR>
<BR>
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<BR>
users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<BR>
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<BR>
that program using a modified version of the Library.<BR>
<BR>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<BR>
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The<BR>
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<BR>
be combined with the library in order to run.<BR>
<BR>
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR>
<BR>
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<BR>
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<BR>
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<BR>
this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).<BR>
Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<BR>
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<BR>
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<BR>
<BR>
  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<BR>
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the<BR>
Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<BR>
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<BR>
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<BR>
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<BR>
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<BR>
<BR>
  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<BR>
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<BR>
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<BR>
and installation of the library.<BR>
<BR>
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<BR>
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<BR>
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<BR>
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<BR>
and what the program that uses the Library does.<BR>
  <BR>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s<BR>
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<BR>
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<BR>
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<BR>
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<BR>
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<BR>
Library.<BR>
<BR>
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<BR>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<BR>
fee.<BR>
<BR>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<BR>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<BR>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR>
<BR>
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<BR>
<BR>
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<BR>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR>
<BR>
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<BR>
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<BR>
<BR>
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<BR>
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<BR>
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<BR>
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<BR>
    in the event an application does not supply such function or<BR>
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<BR>
    its purpose remains meaningful.<BR>
<BR>
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<BR>
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<BR>
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<BR>
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<BR>
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<BR>
    root function must still compute square roots.)<BR>
<BR>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<BR>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<BR>
it.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>
collective works based on the Library.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<BR>
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<BR>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>
the scope of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<BR>
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<BR>
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<BR>
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<BR>
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<BR>
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<BR>
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<BR>
these notices.<BR>
<BR>
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<BR>
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<BR>
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<BR>
<BR>
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<BR>
the Library into a program that is not a library.<BR>
<BR>
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<BR>
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<BR>
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<BR>
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<BR>
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<BR>
medium customarily used for software interchange.<BR>
<BR>
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<BR>
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<BR>
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<BR>
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR>
<BR>
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<BR>
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<BR>
linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a<BR>
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<BR>
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<BR>
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<BR>
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<BR>
library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<BR>
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<BR>
<BR>
  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<BR>
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<BR>
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<BR>
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<BR>
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<BR>
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<BR>
<BR>
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<BR>
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<BR>
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<BR>
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<BR>
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<BR>
Library will still fall under Section 6.)<BR>
<BR>
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<BR>
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<BR>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<BR>
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<BR>
<BR>
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<BR>
link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<BR>
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<BR>
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<BR>
modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse<BR>
engineering for debugging such modifications.<BR>
<BR>
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<BR>
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<BR>
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<BR>
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<BR>
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<BR>
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<BR>
of these things:<BR>
<BR>
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<BR>
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<BR>
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<BR>
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<BR>
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<BR>
    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<BR>
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<BR>
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<BR>
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<BR>
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<BR>
    to use the modified definitions.)<BR>
<BR>
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<BR>
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<BR>
    copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,<BR>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<BR>
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<BR>
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<BR>
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<BR>
<BR>
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<BR>
    least three years, to give the same user the materials<BR>
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<BR>
    than the cost of performing this distribution.<BR>
<BR>
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<BR>
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<BR>
    specified materials from the same place.<BR>
<BR>
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<BR>
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<BR>
<BR>
  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<BR>
Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<BR>
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<BR>
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<BR>
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<BR>
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<BR>
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<BR>
the executable.<BR>
<BR>
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<BR>
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<BR>
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<BR>
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<BR>
distribute.<BR>
<BR>
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<BR>
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<BR>
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<BR>
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<BR>
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<BR>
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<BR>
<BR>
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<BR>
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<BR>
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<BR>
    Sections above.<BR>
<BR>
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<BR>
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<BR>
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<BR>
<BR>
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<BR>
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<BR>
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<BR>
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<BR>
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<BR>
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<BR>
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<BR>
<BR>
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<BR>
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>
the Library or works based on it.<BR>
<BR>
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<BR>
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<BR>
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>
restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<BR>
this License.<BR>
<BR>
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<BR>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<BR>
<BR>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<BR>
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<BR>
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<BR>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>
impose that choice.<BR>
<BR>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<BR>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<BR>
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<BR>
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<BR>
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<BR>
written in the body of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<BR>
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<BR>
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<BR>
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<BR>
<BR>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<BR>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<BR>
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<BR>
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<BR>
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<BR>
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<BR>
the Free Software Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<BR>
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<BR>
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<BR>
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<BR>
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<BR>
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<BR>
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<BR>
and reuse of software generally.<BR>
<BR>
    false WARRANTY<BR>
<BR>
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS false<BR>
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<BR>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<BR>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<BR>

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<BR>
<BR>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<BR>
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<BR>
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<BR>
ordinary General Public License).<BR>
<BR>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<BR>
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<BR>
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR>
<BR>
    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<BR>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<BR>
<BR>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<BR>
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<BR>
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<BR>
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<BR>
<BR>
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<BR>
    Lesser General Public License for more details.<BR>
<BR>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<BR>
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<BR>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<BR>
<BR>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR>
<BR>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<BR>
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if<BR>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<BR>
<BR>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<BR>
  library &#39;Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<BR>
<BR>
  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<BR>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<BR>
<BR>
That&#39;s all there is to it!<BR>
