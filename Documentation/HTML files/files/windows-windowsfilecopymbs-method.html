<B>Function:</B> 
Copy the files specified in the source parameter to the location specified in the dest parameter.<BR>
<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
This method has several varations so you can call it with a folderitem or a string to specify a file or folder. You can also pass an array of folderitems or strings to delete several files/folders in one operation.<BR>
<BR>
source:<BR>
These names should be fully-qualified paths to prevent unexpected results.<BR>
Standard Microsoft MS-DOS wildcard characters, such as &quot;*&quot;, are permitted only in the file-name position. Using a wildcard character elsewhere in the string will lead to unpredictable results.<BR>
<BR>
dest:<BR>
The destination file or directory name. Wildcard characters are not allowed. Their use will lead to unpredictable results.<BR>
<BR>
Copy and Move operations can specify destination directories that do not exist. In those cases, the system attempts to create them and normally displays a dialog box to ask the user if they want to create the new directory. To suppress this dialog box and have the directories created silently, set the FileOperationNoConfirmationMkDir flag in Flags.<BR>
For Copy and Move operations, the buffer can contain multiple destination file names if the fFlags member specifies FileOperationMultiDestFiles.<BR>
Use fully-qualified paths. Using relative paths is not prohibited, but can have unpredictable results.<BR>
<BR>
Use the FileOperation* constants for the flags.<BR>
If a dialog is displayed, the window used in the parent property is used for the parent window.<BR>
If ProgressTitle is not empty, this string is used to specify the progress window title text.<BR>
<BR>
Returns true on success and false on failure.<BR>

<B>Function:</B> 
Copy the files specified in the source parameter to the location specified in the dest parameter.<BR>
<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
This method has several varations so you can call it with a folderitem or a string to specify a file or folder. You can also pass an array of folderitems or strings to delete several files/folders in one operation.<BR>
<BR>
source:<BR>
These names should be fully-qualified paths to prevent unexpected results.<BR>
Standard Microsoft MS-DOS wildcard characters, such as &quot;*&quot;, are permitted only in the file-name position. Using a wildcard character elsewhere in the string will lead to unpredictable results.<BR>
<BR>
dest:<BR>
The destination file or directory name. Wildcard characters are not allowed. Their use will lead to unpredictable results.<BR>
<BR>
Copy and Move operations can specify destination directories that do not exist. In those cases, the system attempts to create them and normally displays a dialog box to ask the user if they want to create the new directory. To suppress this dialog box and have the directories created silently, set the FileOperationNoConfirmationMkDir flag in Flags.<BR>
For Copy and Move operations, the buffer can contain multiple destination file names if the fFlags member specifies FileOperationMultiDestFiles.<BR>
Use fully-qualified paths. Using relative paths is not prohibited, but can have unpredictable results.<BR>
<BR>
Use the FileOperation* constants for the flags.<BR>
If a dialog is displayed, the window used in the parent property is used for the parent window.<BR>
If ProgressTitle is not empty, this string is used to specify the progress window title text.<BR>
<BR>
Returns true on success and false on failure.<BR>

<B>Function:</B> 
Move the files specified in the source parameter to the location specified in the dest parameter.<BR>
<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
This method has several varations so you can call it with a folderitem or a string to specify a file or folder. You can also pass an array of folderitems or strings to delete several files/folders in one operation.<BR>
<BR>
source:<BR>
These names should be fully-qualified paths to prevent unexpected results.<BR>
Standard Microsoft MS-DOS wildcard characters, such as &quot;*&quot;, are permitted only in the file-name position. Using a wildcard character elsewhere in the string will lead to unpredictable results.<BR>
<BR>
dest:<BR>
The destination file or directory name. Wildcard characters are not allowed. Their use will lead to unpredictable results.<BR>
<BR>
Copy and Move operations can specify destination directories that do not exist. In those cases, the system attempts to create them and normally displays a dialog box to ask the user if they want to create the new directory. To suppress this dialog box and have the directories created silently, set the FileOperationNoConfirmationMkDir flag in Flags.<BR>
For Copy and Move operations, the buffer can contain multiple destination file names if the fFlags member specifies FileOperationMultiDestFiles.<BR>
Use fully-qualified paths. Using relative paths is not prohibited, but can have unpredictable results.<BR>
<BR>
Use the FileOperation* constants for the flags.<BR>
If a dialog is displayed, the window used in the parent property is used for the parent window.<BR>
If ProgressTitle is not empty, this string is used to specify the progress window title text.<BR>
<BR>
Returns true on success and false on failure.<BR>
