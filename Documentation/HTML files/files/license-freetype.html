<B>Function:</B> 
The FreeType 2.3.9 license<BR>
<B>Notes:</B> 
<BR>
The  FreeType 2  font  engine is  copyrighted  work and  cannot be  used<BR>
legally  without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project<BR>
usable  to a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two<BR>
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.<BR>
<BR>
This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses described<BR>
below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using FreeType 2 in<BR>
any of your projects or products.<BR>
<BR>
  - The FreeType License, found in  the file &#39;FTL.TXT&#39;, which is similar<BR>
    to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces<BR>
    you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product&#39;s<BR>
    documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license<BR>
    is  suited  to products  which  don&#39;t  use  the GNU  General  Public<BR>
    License.<BR>
<BR>
  - The GNU  General Public License  version 2, found in  &#39;GPL.TXT&#39; (any<BR>
    later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the<BR>
    GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible with the  GPL due  to its<BR>
    advertisement clause.<BR>
<BR>
The contributed PCF driver comes with a license similar to that of the X<BR>
Window System.   It is  compatible to the  above two licenses  (see file<BR>
src/pcf/readme).<BR>

<BR>
Introduction<BR>
============<BR>
<BR>
  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;<BR>
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<BR>
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the<BR>
  FreeType Project.<BR>
<BR>
  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and<BR>
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license<BR>
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,<BR>
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.<BR>
<BR>
  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG<BR>
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion<BR>
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products<BR>
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:<BR>
<BR>
    o We don&#39;t promise that this software works. However, we will be<BR>
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (&#39;as is&#39; distribution)<BR>
<BR>
    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or<BR>
      full form, without having to pay us. (&#39;royalty-free&#39; usage)<BR>
<BR>
    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use<BR>
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge<BR>
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the<BR>
      FreeType code. (&#39;credits&#39;)<BR>
<BR>
  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this<BR>
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.<BR>
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and<BR>
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a<BR>
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus<BR>
  encourage you to use the following text:<BR>
<BR>
   &quot;&quot;&quot;<BR>
    Portions of this software are copyright &copy; &lt;year&gt; The FreeType<BR>
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.<BR>
   &quot;&quot;&quot;<BR>
<BR>
  Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you<BR>
  actually use.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Legal Terms<BR>
===========<BR>
<BR>
0. Definitions<BR>
--------------<BR>
<BR>
  Throughout this license,  the terms &#39;package&#39;, &#39;FreeType Project&#39;,<BR>
  and  &#39;FreeType  archive&#39; refer  to  the  set  of files  originally<BR>
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and<BR>
  Werner Lemberg) as the &#39;FreeType Project&#39;, be they named as alpha,<BR>
  beta or final release.<BR>
<BR>
  &#39;You&#39; refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where<BR>
  &#39;using&#39; is a generic term including compiling the project&#39;s source<BR>
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  &#39;program&#39; or &#39;executable&#39;.<BR>
  This  program is  referred to  as  &#39;a program  using the  FreeType<BR>
  engine&#39;.<BR>
<BR>
  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original<BR>
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and<BR>
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its<BR>
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.<BR>
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by<BR>
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.<BR>
<BR>
  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,<BR>
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as<BR>
  specified below.<BR>
<BR>
1. No Warranty<BR>
--------------<BR>
<BR>
  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED &#39;AS IS&#39; WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY<BR>
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,<BR>
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR<BR>
  PURPOSE.  IN false EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS<BR>
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO<BR>
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.<BR>
<BR>
2. Redistribution<BR>
-----------------<BR>
<BR>
  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and<BR>
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,<BR>
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and<BR>
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code<BR>
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to<BR>
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted<BR>
  herein, subject to the following conditions:<BR>
<BR>
    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file<BR>
      (&#39;FTL.TXT&#39;) unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to<BR>
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying<BR>
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,<BR>
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source<BR>
      files.<BR>
<BR>
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that<BR>
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the<BR>
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also<BR>
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your<BR>
      documentation, though this isn&#39;t mandatory.<BR>
<BR>
  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on<BR>
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use<BR>
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid<BR>
  to us.<BR>
<BR>
3. Advertising<BR>
--------------<BR>
<BR>
  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use<BR>
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional<BR>
  purposes without specific prior written permission.<BR>
<BR>
  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the<BR>
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation<BR>
  or advertising  materials: &#39;FreeType Project&#39;,  &#39;FreeType Engine&#39;,<BR>
  &#39;FreeType library&#39;, or &#39;FreeType Distribution&#39;.<BR>
<BR>
  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to<BR>
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted<BR>
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the<BR>
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.<BR>
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType<BR>
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<BR>
  of this license.<BR>

    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>
       Version 2, June 1991<BR>
<BR>
 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<BR>
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<BR>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<BR>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<BR>
<BR>
    Preamble<BR>
<BR>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<BR>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<BR>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<BR>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<BR>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<BR>
Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to<BR>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<BR>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<BR>
your programs, too.<BR>
<BR>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<BR>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<BR>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<BR>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<BR>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<BR>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<BR>
<BR>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<BR>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<BR>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<BR>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<BR>
<BR>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<BR>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<BR>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<BR>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<BR>
rights.<BR>
<BR>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<BR>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<BR>
distribute and/or modify the software.<BR>
<BR>
  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain<BR>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<BR>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<BR>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<BR>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<BR>
authors&#39; reputations.<BR>
<BR>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<BR>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<BR>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<BR>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<BR>
patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.<BR>
<BR>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<BR>
modification follow.<BR>
<BR>
    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<BR>
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<BR>
<BR>
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<BR>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<BR>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<BR>
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<BR>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<BR>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<BR>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<BR>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<BR>
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<BR>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<BR>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<BR>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<BR>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<BR>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<BR>
<BR>
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s<BR>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<BR>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<BR>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<BR>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<BR>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<BR>
along with the Program.<BR>
<BR>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<BR>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<BR>
<BR>
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<BR>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<BR>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<BR>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<BR>
<BR>
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<BR>
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<BR>
<BR>
    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<BR>
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<BR>
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<BR>
    parties under the terms of this License.<BR>
<BR>
    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<BR>
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<BR>
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<BR>
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<BR>
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<BR>
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<BR>
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<BR>
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<BR>
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<BR>
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<BR>
<BR>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<BR>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<BR>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<BR>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<BR>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<BR>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<BR>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<BR>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<BR>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<BR>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<BR>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<BR>
collective works based on the Program.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<BR>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<BR>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<BR>
the scope of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<BR>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<BR>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<BR>
<BR>
    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<BR>
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<BR>
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR>
<BR>
    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<BR>
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<BR>
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<BR>
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<BR>
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<BR>
    customarily used for software interchange; or,<BR>
<BR>
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<BR>
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<BR>
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<BR>
    received the program in object code or executable form with such<BR>
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<BR>
<BR>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<BR>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<BR>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<BR>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<BR>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<BR>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<BR>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<BR>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<BR>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<BR>
itself accompanies the executable.<BR>
<BR>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<BR>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<BR>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<BR>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<BR>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<BR>
<BR>
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<BR>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<BR>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<BR>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<BR>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<BR>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<BR>
parties remain in full compliance.<BR>
<BR>
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<BR>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<BR>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<BR>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<BR>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<BR>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<BR>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<BR>
the Program or works based on it.<BR>
<BR>
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<BR>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<BR>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<BR>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<BR>
restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.<BR>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<BR>
this License.<BR>
<BR>
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<BR>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<BR>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<BR>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<BR>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<BR>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<BR>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<BR>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<BR>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<BR>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<BR>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<BR>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<BR>
<BR>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<BR>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<BR>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<BR>
circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<BR>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<BR>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<BR>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<BR>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<BR>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<BR>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<BR>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<BR>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<BR>
impose that choice.<BR>
<BR>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<BR>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<BR>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<BR>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<BR>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<BR>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<BR>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<BR>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<BR>
<BR>
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<BR>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<BR>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<BR>
address new problems or concerns.<BR>
<BR>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<BR>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<BR>
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<BR>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<BR>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<BR>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<BR>
Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<BR>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<BR>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<BR>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<BR>
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<BR>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<BR>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<BR>
<BR>
    false WARRANTY<BR>
<BR>
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS false WARRANTY<BR>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<BR>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<BR>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<BR>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<BR>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<BR>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<BR>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<BR>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<BR>
<BR>
  12. IN false EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<BR>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<BR>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<BR>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<BR>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<BR>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<BR>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<BR>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<BR>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<BR>
<BR>
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR>
<BR>
    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<BR>
<BR>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<BR>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<BR>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<BR>
<BR>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<BR>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<BR>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<BR>
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<BR>
<BR>
    &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<BR>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<BR>
<BR>
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<BR>
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<BR>
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<BR>
    (at your option) any later version.<BR>
<BR>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<BR>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<BR>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<BR>
    GNU General Public License for more details.<BR>
<BR>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<BR>
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<BR>
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<BR>
<BR>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<BR>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<BR>
<BR>
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author<BR>
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY false WARRANTY; for details type &#39;show w&#39;.<BR>
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<BR>
    under certain conditions; type &#39;show c&#39; for details.<BR>
<BR>
The hypothetical commands &#39;show w&#39; and &#39;show c&#39; should show the appropriate<BR>
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<BR>
be called something other than &#39;show w&#39; and &#39;show c&#39;; they could even be<BR>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<BR>
<BR>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<BR>
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if<BR>
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<BR>
<BR>
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<BR>
  &#39;Gnomovision&#39; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<BR>
<BR>
  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<BR>
  Ty Coon, President of Vice<BR>
<BR>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<BR>
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<BR>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<BR>
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<BR>
Public License instead of this License.<BR>
