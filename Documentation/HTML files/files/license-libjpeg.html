In plain English:<BR>
<BR>
1. We don&#39;t promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,<BR>
   please let us know!)<BR>
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don&#39;t have to pay us.<BR>
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a<BR>
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that<BR>
   you&#39;ve used the IJG code.<BR>
<BR>
In legalese:<BR>
<BR>
The authors make false WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,<BR>
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or<BR>
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;, and you,<BR>
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.<BR>
<BR>
This software is copyright (C) 1991-2010, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.<BR>
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.<BR>
<BR>
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this<BR>
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these<BR>
conditions:<BR>
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this<BR>
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice<BR>
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files<BR>
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.<BR>
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying<BR>
documentation must state that &quot;this software is based in part on the work of<BR>
the Independent JPEG Group&quot;.<BR>
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts<BR>
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept<BR>
false LIABILITY for damages of any kind.<BR>
<BR>
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,<BR>
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to<BR>
acknowledge us.<BR>
<BR>
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author&#39;s name or company name<BR>
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from<BR>
it.  This software may be referred to only as &quot;the Independent JPEG Group&#39;s<BR>
software&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of<BR>
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are<BR>
assumed by the product vendor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,<BR>
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.<BR>
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead<BR>
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,<BR>
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file<BR>
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part<BR>
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than<BR>
the foregoing paragraphs do.<BR>
<BR>
The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with GNU Autoconf.<BR>
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.<BR>
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,<BR>
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium<BR>
but is also freely distributable.<BR>
<BR>
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.<BR>
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has<BR>
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce<BR>
&quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the<BR>
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard<BR>
GIF decoders.<BR>
<BR>
We are required to state that<BR>
    &quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of<BR>
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of<BR>
    CompuServe Incorporated.&quot;<BR>
